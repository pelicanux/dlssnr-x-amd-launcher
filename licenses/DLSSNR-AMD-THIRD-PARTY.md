# Third-party components

None of these are stored in this repository. `fetch_deps.sh` downloads them at pinned versions;
the build compiles against some of them and the packages carry some of them unmodified, each with
its licence file.

| Component | Licence | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [DLSS5-Feeder](https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder) | MIT | The ReShade add-on (`*/src/pe/nr_reshade_addon.cpp`) follows its design; `DLSS5_Feed.fx` is shipped. Its bundled MinHook, ReShade add-on headers and Dear ImGui headers are compiled in. |
| [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) | BSD-2-Clause | Compiled into the DLLs (from DLSS5-Feeder's copy). |

| [vort_Shaders](https://github.com/vortigern11/vort_Shaders) | MIT | Motion vectors for the ReShade routes, shipped. |
| [OptiScaler-NR](https://github.com/wilsjo2/OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass) 0.8.4 | GPL-3.0 | The OptiScaler route's host, shipped as released; this project's DLLs are separate modules it loads. |

NVIDIA's `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` and the weights in it are NVIDIA's property. This project contains no part
of them; `linux/package/model-tools/` reads them from a copy the user supplies. The layer table in
`*/src/core/nr_native_plan_data.hpp` and `linux/package/model-tools/descriptor.json` describe the
network's structure (layer types, shapes, offsets), not its weights.
